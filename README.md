#ATLAS open data

A repository containing a Python notebook and associated files. The notebook is designed to help readers understand the process of cut-based optimisation in particle physics, and the processes and challenges with finding dark matter at CERN. Upon completion of the notebook, we move on to the use of machine learning instead of cut-based optimisation.
