# ATLAS open data

A repository containing a Jupyter notebook and associated files. The notebook is designed to help readers understand the process of cut-based optimisation in particle physics, and the processes and challenges with finding dark matter at CERN. Uses the 13TeV ATLAS Open Data dataset. Upon completion of the notebook, we move on to the use of machine learning instead of cut-based optimisation. 

This notebook was originally designed through Google Colaboratory, so it's recommended that you open it in that environment. 
To do this, you can simply [**click on this link**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MsY9orhTJnEPar2UAV1j1vj4j9UkZG4_?usp=sharing). 

If that doesn't work for you, then follow these steps: First download the raw file for the notebook, from the [preview page of the notebook](https://github.com/IDalziel/Dark-Matter-search-with-Cut-Based-Optimisation/blob/main/2024_Dark_Matter_Search_with_Cut_Based_Optimisation%20(1).ipynb) in the Github repository. The download option is to the top-right of the central window. Next, upload this raw file to [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) through the "file"-->"upload notebook" options. These are in the top left of the website frontpage.
