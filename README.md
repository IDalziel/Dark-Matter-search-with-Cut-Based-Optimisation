# ATLAS open data

A repository containing a Jupyter notebook and associated files. The notebook is designed to help readers understand the process of cut-based optimisation in particle physics, and the processes and challenges with finding dark matter at CERN. Uses the 13TeV ATLAS Open Data dateset. Upon completion of the notebook, we move on to the use of machine learning instead of cut-based optimisation. 

This notebook was originally designed through Google Colaboratory, and will perform best when run in that environment. 
To do this, first download the raw file for the notebook, from the [preview page of the notebook](https://github.com/IDalziel/Dark-Matter-search-with-Cut-Based-Optimisation/blob/main/2024_%20Dark%20Matter%20Search%20with%20Cut-Based%20Optimisation.ipynb) in this repository. The download option is to the top-right of the central window. Next, upload this raw file to [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) through the "file"-->"upload notebook" options. These are in the top left of the website frontpage.
